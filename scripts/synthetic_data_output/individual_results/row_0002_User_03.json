One simple trick is meal prepping on your days off\u2014cook a batch of protein and veggies, then just heat them up during the week. That way you can spend the evening with the kids instead of cooking from scratch. Also, setting a reminder in your phone for 'family dinner time' can help keep it top of mind."
