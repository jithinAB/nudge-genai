It also gives you tangible progress to show yourself, which can boost motivation. Would you prefer something that you can do indoors or outdoors?"

Look at how many developers are sharing their indie projects on platforms like itch.io; seeing those success stories can reinforce that learning new tools directly translates into real-world outcomes. I recommend starting with a beginner\u2019s Unity course\u2014there are free tutorials, and you\u2019ll get instant feedback by building small playable levels."

        "message": "It\u2019s true that many employers value hands-on projects over certificates, especially in fast-moving tech fields. However, a recognized certification can serve as social proof of your expertise when you\u2019re applying to new roles or pitching freelance gigs. Think about the balance: if you already have a portfolio of cloud-based projects, a certification could validate those skills and help differentiate you."

The visibility you gain will both reinforce your confidence and act as social proof to recruiters, potentially making the certification feel like an earned bonus rather than a prerequisite."
