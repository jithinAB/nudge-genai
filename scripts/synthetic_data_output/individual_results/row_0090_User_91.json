    "reasoning": "I considered that a 27\u2011year\u2011old British software developer would likely ask about tech tools, productivity, and work\u2011life balance, while also valuing skill growth over formal credentials. His belief in hobbies for wellbeing suggests he might discuss how to incorporate coding side projects or sports into his routine. The social proof bias means he\u2019ll look for evidence that others have succeeded before adopting a new practice or tool.\n\nScenario 1 focuses on productivity tools: the person wants to know whether a new time\u2011tracking app is worth it, and will reference peers who use it. Scenario 2 deals with hobby integration: he\u2019s looking for ways to balance coding with cycling, again citing that friends have done this successfully. Each dialogue has 12 exchanges, uses informal British tone, and subtly shows the bias by mentioning what others are doing.\n\nThe AI replies neutrally, offering data or suggestions without endorsing a particular choice, allowing the person\u2019s social proof bias to influence his final decision.",
