So conversation may focus on ending with strong point.\n\nScenario1: discuss a client case where immigrant child faces bullying; person says hold on culture, adapt. AI suggests resources. Person ends with strong statement about dignity over money.\n\nScenario2: talk about policy changes for women of colour in workplace. Person expresses double standard. AI offers data. End with dismissing money focus.\n\nReturn JSON."
