One thing that often helps is focusing on specific performance metrics\u2014like your sprint times or goal-scoring stats\u2014and sharing those with clubs or agents. That way, when a scout looks at your profile, they see concrete evidence of your progress rather than just the impression of your hard work."

Highlighting your recent growth could shift their perception more than a single prior exposure would."

Remember that proper form and progressive overload are more important than raw weight. Focusing on technique can actually make you stronger in the long run, which will help you maintain that status of physical strength you value."
