Her belief that Kerala society is conservative for women in tech informs her questions about gender dynamics and career progression.\n\nFor each scenario I crafted 12 exchanges to keep the dialogue within the 10\u201115 range. The person\u2019s tone is pragmatic, slightly skeptical, and occasionally defensive when a suggestion could mean losing money or status. Subtle loss aversion shows up as she often frames choices in terms of \u201cwhat if I lose X\u201d rather than just \u201chow much will it cost\u201d.
