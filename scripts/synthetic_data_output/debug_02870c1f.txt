  "reasoning": "The persona is a 32‑year‑old White American elementary teacher who values patience, empathy, community interaction, and routine. She likely discusses school planning, parenting strategies, or neighborhood events with an AI. Her belief in community strength leads her to ask for ideas that involve neighbors and routines. The social proof bias will surface when she references what others have done or heard from peers, sometimes using it as justification for a decision. I crafted two realistic 10‑exchange dialogues: Scenario 1 centers on organizing a neighborhood potluck; the teacher uses social proof by citing other teachers’ successful events. Scenario 2 involves planning a classroom empathy lesson; she again references peer practices and looks for evidence that many teachers use similar strategies, subtly displaying her bias.",
